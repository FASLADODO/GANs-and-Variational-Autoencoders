    "# Cost Function (part 2)<hr>\n",
    "- Normally, we would have gone straight to implementation by now, but there are more important points to cover\n",
    "- Not obvious: there are some problems with the cost function we just defined\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem\n",
    "- The cost function from perspective of the generator is problematic\n",
    "![problem_cost_function](../images/problem_cost_function.PNG)\n",
    "The first term corresponds to real images and the second term corresponds to fake images generated by the generator.<br>\n",
    "The first term with respect to the generator phram is zero because the generator phram don't appear anywhere in that term.<br>\n",
    "So the only relevant part from the perspective of the generator is the second term.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gradient of 1st term wrt \\\\(\\theta_G\\\\) is 0\n",
    "- So only the 2nd term is relevant\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem (cont.)\n",
    "- Suppose the discriminator is very successful at telling the difference between real and fake\n",
    "- Then D(G(z)) is very close to 0 \n",
    "- The slope at this point also very close to 0\n",
    "- Problematic because \\\\(\\theta_G\\\\) changes in a direction proportional to gradient\n",
    "- When the discriminator is too good, the generator has no chance to improve ! \n",

    "## Solution\n",
    "- Use a different cost function for the generator\n",
    "- \" Flip the target \"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instead of a target 0 for fake images, the generator wants the target to be 1\n",
    "- Makes sense because the term log(D(any image)) corresponds to the log-likelihood of the target being 1 \n",

    "![cost_problem_3](../images/cost_problem_3.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes\n",
    "- Since \\\\(J^{(G)} + J^{(D)} != 0 \\\\), this is no longer a zero-sum game (any theoretical analysis done on such a game no longer applies)\n",
    "- You may see this \"fixed\" generator cost referred to as a \"non-saturating heuristic\"\n",
    "- \"Non-saturating\" -> gradient doesn't fall to 0\n",
    "- \"Heuristic\" -> no theoretical (probabilistic) reasoning, just solves a numerical issue\n",

    "## Diagram\n",
    "![cost_diagram](../images/cost_diagram.PNG)\n",
    "Starting from the very left we can see that we start with a latent variable z which is generated from a uniform distribution.<br>\n",
    "This is fed into the generator which is a neural network that just generates something that has the same shape as the training data.<br>\n",
    "We'll call these X hat then we'll have some data coming from an actual training data which we'll call x.<br>\n",
    "Both of these will feed into the discriminator which outputs the decision and from that we can build a binary cross entropy cost function.<br>\n",
    "But this decision is also used in order to build the generator cost function.<br>\n",
    "And so it feeds into that as well."
